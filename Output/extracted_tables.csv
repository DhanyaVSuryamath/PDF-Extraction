Library,Best For,Notes
PyPDF2,Basic text extraction,Simple but not good at preserving layout; cannot handle tables well.
PyMuPDF (fitz),Text with layout + metadata,"Extracts text by blocks, words, and coordinates â€” useful for table-like structures."
PDFMiner.six,Detailed text extraction,Fine-grained control over text positioning; steeper learning curve.
PDFPlumber,Text + structured extraction,"Built on PDFMiner; provides easy access to words, lines, bounding boxes."
pdfrw,Low-level PDF manipulation,"Good for editing/merging PDFs, but not ideal for extraction."
Slate,Wrapper over PDFMiner,Easier interface but largely outdated.
textract,Multiple file formats,Handles PDFs but relies on other tools; heavier dependency.
