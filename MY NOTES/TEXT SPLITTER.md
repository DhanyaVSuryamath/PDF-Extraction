Here‚Äôs a summary of *Text Splitters* from LangChain‚Äôs documentation:

---

## What are Text Splitters

* Text splitters are tools or utilities that break down large documents into smaller chunks (sections) for downstream processing. ([LangChain][1])
* They are useful because large texts can be unwieldy, violate model input size limits, or produce low-quality embeddings/representations. ([LangChain][1])

---

## Why Split Documents

Some of the main motivations:

1. **Handling non-uniform document lengths** ‚Äì Documents (PDFs, web pages, etc.) often vary a lot in size; splitting makes processing more consistent. ([LangChain][1])
2. **Overcoming model input limits** ‚Äì Many LLMs or embedding models have maximum token/character limits. Splitting ensures no chunk exceeds those. ([LangChain][1])
3. **Better quality of text representations** ‚Äì Long texts may dilute relevance or semantic coherence; smaller chunks give more focused, better embeddings. ([LangChain][1])
4. **Improved retrieval precision** ‚Äì In search/retrieval tasks, small chunks allow more precise matching of queries to the relevant part of a document. ([LangChain][1])
5. **Optimizing computational resources** ‚Äì Smaller chunks are more memory‚Äêefficient and parallelizable. ([LangChain][1])

## Main Approaches to Splitting Text

The documentation describes several strategies, each with its trade-offs:

| Strategy                      | How it works / Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Pros                                                                                                                        | When useful / Trade-offs                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Length-based**              | Split by number of tokens or characters. E.g. using `CharacterTextSplitter` in LangChain, with configurable `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`. ([LangChain][1])                                                                         | Simple, predictable chunk sizes, easy to implement.                                                                         | Might cut off semantics in the middle of sentences or paragraphs; overlap helps but adds redundancy. Best when exact size limits are important. |
| **Text-structured based**     | Use natural linguistic or structural units‚Äîparagraphs, sentences, words. E.g. `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` which tries to keep larger units like paragraphs, but if too big, falls back to sentences, then words. ([LangChain][1]) | Helps preserve natural language flow, avoids splitting in awkward places. More semantically coherent chunks.                | Slightly more complex; may produce uneven chunk sizes; may require more logic to manage overlap or edge cases.                                  |
| **Document-structured based** | Exploit native structure of the document: Markdown headers, HTML tags, JSON object/arrays, code blocks (functions/classes) etc. ([LangChain][1])                                                                                       | Maintains logical organization; chunks align with document‚Äôs inherent structure, which is good for readability and context. | Requires parsing of document format; sometimes structure is shallow or noisy; structure doesn‚Äôt always match semantic breaks.                   |
| **Semantic meaning based**    | Use content semantics: e.g. sliding window of sentences, compute embeddings, detect where meaning shifts, then split accordingly. ([LangChain][1])                                                                                     | Best for ensuring each chunk is semantically coherent; good for retrieval, summarization, etc.                              | More computationally expensive; may need embedding model; thresholding meaning shifts can be tricky; risk of over-splitting/under-splitting.    |

## Example Use-Cases / Tools in LangChain

* `CharacterTextSplitter` ‚Äî split by characters, often using a tokenizer (tokenizer encoding) to ensure splits align with token limits. ([LangChain][1])

* `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` ‚Äî preserves structure (paragraph, sentence, word levels) as much as possible. ([LangChain][1])

* Splitting based on Markdown headers, HTML structure, code blocks, JSON objects etc. are supported or encouraged when the document has structure. ([LangChain][1])

---

## Caveats / Things to Consider

* Chunk overlap is often needed: to preserve context especially near chunk boundaries. Without overlap, you may lose meaning that spans chunks. (Most splitters provide an option for overlap.) ([LangChain][1])
* Very small or very large chunk sizes can hurt performance: too small ‚Üí noise, too many chunks; too large ‚Üí same issues as unsplit document.
* Semantic splitters need good embedding models; also deciding when ‚Äúmeaning changes enough‚Äù can be nontrivial.
* Document formats with poor or inconsistent structure may be harder to split well via structured methods.

Here‚Äôs a **cheat-sheet for LangChain Text Splitters**:

# üîπ LangChain Text Splitters Cheat-Sheet

### 1. **Length-Based Splitters**

* **Class**: `CharacterTextSplitter`
* **How it works**: Splits by characters or tokens, with options for `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`.
* ‚úÖ Pros: Simple, predictable, easy to enforce size limits.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Can cut sentences/paragraphs awkwardly; may lose context.

**Example**:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_text(long_text)
```

---

### 2. **Recursive Splitters**

* **Class**: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
* **How it works**: Tries to split at larger natural boundaries (paragraphs ‚Üí sentences ‚Üí words).
* ‚úÖ Pros: Keeps text coherent, avoids breaking mid-sentence.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Uneven chunk sizes, slightly more complex.

**Example**:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_text(long_text)
```

---

### 3. **Document-Structured Splitters**

* **Examples**:

  * Markdown (`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`)
  * HTML (`HTMLSectionSplitter`)
  * Code (`Language` aware splitters for Python, JS, etc.)
* **How it works**: Uses the document‚Äôs inherent structure (headings, tags, code blocks).
* ‚úÖ Pros: Preserves logical sections, useful for structured docs.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Needs parsing; only works if the format is consistent.

**Example**:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter

splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on=[("#", "Header 1"), ("##", "Header 2")])
chunks = splitter.split_text(markdown_text)
```

---

### 4. **Semantic Splitters**

* **How it works**: Uses embeddings/sentence meaning to detect where to split.
* ‚úÖ Pros: Each chunk is semantically coherent, great for retrieval.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Computationally expensive; requires embedding model.

*(Currently more experimental, often implemented via custom pipelines rather than a built-in class.)*

---

# üìå Key Parameters to Tune

* `chunk_size`: Max size of each piece (tokens/characters).
* `chunk_overlap`: Extra text carried from the previous chunk to maintain context.
* `separators`: List of boundaries (`["\n\n", "\n", " "]`) for recursive splitting.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Choosing the Right Splitter

| Scenario                        | Best Choice                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Raw text, strict size control   | **CharacterTextSplitter**          |
| Articles, essays, reports       | **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** |
| Markdown/HTML/code docs         | **Structured splitters**           |
| Retrieval precision & coherence | **Semantic splitter**              |
